# Nuggets of Wisdom.
I will attempt to collect and collate little nuggets of wisdowm I have gleened here.


## DevOps
### Ansible

### Ansible Tower

### Continuous Deployment
- The dream.

### Continous Development

### Continous Integration

### DevOPs Planning

### Code Management
- Reduce idle code wherever possible.

#### Testing
##### General Testing
- tests should be descriptive of the problem to be solved, not prescriptive of the technology that should be used
- Part of testing should include a security review.
- Something isn't urgent unless it is so critical that you can't grab dinner until its fixed. 

##### Unit Testing
- Tests before code.

### Git Implementation
- There's a branch for that.
- Sign your commits and I won't throw no fits.
- If there is a way to break it, we will break it.
- If there is a way to fix it, we will fix it. 
- Conflicts are best resolved by whining about them.... evidently.


### Git Usage
- Don't ever use `git add .`
- Write amend messages...
- "just some new function" is not a vaild commit message.

### Jenkins

## General

### Life
 - I do not put my pants on one leg at a time.

### Technology
 - The definition of insanity is trying the same thing over and over again expecting different results. In most cases this is true. But in technology this is a standard operating procedure.

## Languages
### Bash
 - In automating things, don't use bash....
 - In automating things, don't use bash....
 - In automating things, and you use bash, at least you didn't use perl. 

### GoLang
 - The test pkg is there for a reason, use it.
 - Not everything has to be output in json.

### Python
 - Whitespace.

### Ruby

## Project Management
