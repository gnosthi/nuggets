# Nuggets of Wisdom.
I will attempt to collect and collate little nuggets of wisdowm I have gleened here.


## DevOps
### Ansible

### Ansible Tower

### Continuous Deployment
- The dream.

### Continous Development

### Continous Integration

### DevOPs Planning

### Code Management
- Reduce idle code wherever possible.

#### Testing
- tests should be descriptive of the problem to be solved, not prescriptive of the technology that should be used
- Part of testing should include a security review.
- Something isn't urgent unless it is so critical that you can't grab dinner until its fixed. 

### Git Implementation
- There's a branch for that.


### Git Usage
- Don't ever use `git add .`

### Jenkins

## General

### Life
 - I do not put my pants on one leg at a time.

### Technology
 - The definition of insanity is trying the same thing over and over again expecting different results. In most cases this is true. But in technology this is a standard operating procedure.

## Languages

 - In automating things, don't use bash....

### GoLang

### Python

### Ruby

## Project Management
